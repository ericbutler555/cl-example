# CL Example Page

This is just a quick example page I made to show how you can turn the code in your repo into a working, hosted website on GitHub -- for free!

Here's how:

1. Get all your code files into a repo on your GitHub account.

1. In your repo, click on the "Settings" tab.

1. Scroll down until you see the section titled "GitHub Pages."

1. Under "Source," select "master branch" (presuming your code files are in the master branch, which they are by default).

1. Click the "Save" button.

It'll probably take some time to show up, but eventually your site will be published as a real website. The address will be something like:

    https://[your-username].github.io/[your-repo-name]/

That's it.

> **Quick note:** you may try to access the site but find it's giving you a 404 error. Don't go crazy! You just have to wait it out. Eventually it'll work.

Good luck!
